This repository contains a batch-based operating system.
I spent a lot of time on it, and I hope it was worth it.
Now of course this is only version 1.0, and I will continue to come out with new updates.
It is a text-based operating system, and has that kind of old-school vibe to it.
File management is just so much more elegant using commands, instead of moving objects using a GUI.
CLIs are much better.
Let me know what you think.
